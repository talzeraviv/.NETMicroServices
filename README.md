# .NET MicroServices
This project is my experimentation with the .NET MicroServices architecture.
In this project I've created .NET Web API services, functioning as microservices,
Made a messaging communication protocol between the services using RabbitMQ,
containerized each service using Docker and used Kubernetes as my orchestration platform.
